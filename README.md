<h3>How To Play</h3>

Stumbus is a 1v1 game. 

Each player controls one four-player team, either the red team or the black team.

It is entirely turn-based. There's a 50/50 chance of either team going first.

**Turns**

Each turn, each character on a team may either:
- `[a]` - act - perform an action or
- `[p]` - pass - not perform an action

You can also check a character's occupation and favorite hobby when it is their turn by pressing `[l]` - lore.

**Acting**

Each character has 5 moves.

1. `Health Restoration` - The character may restore the specified amount of HP to themselves or a teammate. `Range 1-50`
2. `Physical Attack` - The character may inflict a physical attack on an opponent character. `Range 1-20*`
3. `Elemental Attack` - The character may inflict an elemental attack on an opponent character. `Range 1-20*`
4. `IV Buff` - The character may increase either the `PHY ATK`, `PHY DEF`, `ELM ATK`, or `ELM DEF` (each moved is assigned to only one) of themselves or a teammate by the specified amount. `Range 10-20`
5. `IV Nerf` - The character may decrease either the `PHY ATK`, `PHY DEF`, `ELM ATK`, or `ELM DEF` (each moved is assigned to only one) of an opponent character by the specified amount. `Range 10-20`

One move can be used each time a character acts. There is no move PP.

**The Card Phase**

After each character on the team has either acted or passed, the player controlling the team draws three cards.
They can choose to play or toss each of them.
